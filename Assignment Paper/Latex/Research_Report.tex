\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\subsection{Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Services with Commutative Operations}

\subsubsection{Fault Models} MPH-2 Hybrid Fault Model

\subsubsection{Summary}
The cloud service gets bigger in the contemporary socirty. More and more business activities conducted online via cloud service. When the cloud service contains more criticle missions like international financial, healthcare or personal information. It means the service become common to personal life andwidely used now. So we need to concern both its high availability and high reliability. In this paper mentioned that  "To ensure high availability of such services, replication has been pervasively used with a crash-fault only model". But this is not enough for the currrent society, since the open enviorment face to more risk of malicious concerns. They also suggested to apply to a more general fault mode which give a higher reliability, that is Byzantine fault model. The most common way to apply to Byzantine agreement algorithm may  requires that all requests(replications) are executed sequentially according to the total order established. But this is almost impossible for the cloud-based service since it may impose severe runtime overhead, and it is expensive to do this. Also in this paper denotse that recent research suggest that the service may be constrcuted by using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. And the approch of this paper is to present a study on Byzantine fault tolerant optimistic replication of services with commutative operations. And the service is constructed using conflict-free replicated data types.


\subsection{A self-stabilizing hybrid fault-tolerant synchronization protocol}

\subsubsection{Fault Models} TPH-3 Hybrid Fault Model

\subsubsection{Summary}

In this paper, they present "A strategy for solving the Byzantine general problem for self-stabilizing a fully connected network from an arbitrary state and in the presence of any number of faults with various severities including any number of arbitrary (Byzantine) faulty nodes." \cite{B}. The distributed systems have became an integral part of safety critical computing applications, and it's necessary to give a high reliability which must be designed with a well falt-toleranted system. One of the most important issue need to be solved is that the imprecise local clocks. As the result, this paper brings a strategy for synchronizing a distributed system with various faults, including any number of arbitrary (Byzantine) faults. The strategy designed to do clock sunchronization for the fault-telerant system in two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Converting all Byzantine faults into symmetric faults}
\item{Using a proven symmetric-fault tolerant algorithm to solve the synchronization problem}
\end{itemize}
And they believe that they solve the general case of this problem for fully connected graphs.


\subsection{A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model for a Multi-Cloud Computing}

\subsubsection{Fault Models} MPH-2 Hybrid Fault Model

\subsubsection{Summary}

In this paper, they presented BFT-MCDB (Byzantine Fault Tolerance Multi- Clouds Database). Thats is, a practical model for building a system with Byzantine fault tolerance in a multi-cloud environment. The multi-cloud model doens't mean the group of cloud systems, but it is centrally controlled by an administrative domain which controls other clouds in the same domain. Address to this model, it is disired to build with high reliability and high avaliability. And the model combines Byzantine Agreement protocols and Shamir’s secret sharing approach to detect Byzantine failure. And as the result showed from this model increase system reliability and also increase the avalibility of three security dimesions, that is:
 \begin{itemize}
\item{Data integrity}
\item{Data confidentiality}
\item{Service availability}
\end{itemize}

\section{Lessons Learned}
There are many difficults while I am doing this assignment, I will discuess it briefly below. 

\subsection{How to start}
It's always hard to start for a research work. The basic issue is that what keyword I should use, what library should I look for. Is this paper worth to read through? When does this paper published? And most important is, is it related to what I am looking for. Since we are looking for the "recently" works, I focus on those papers which published during past 5 years. 

\subsection{Greatest hurtles to overcome}
It's not easy to identify what kind of fault model that the paper is applying for. This is, I must understand the topic and the way they use for computational and communication overhead the approaches. So I could compare it with Azadmanesh's models. Thus not every problems are well domained from papers, or I can say they are talking about the big map but not specific. This is the biggest problem I met since I spent too much time to read details of each papers, and think what is the fault model they are applying for.

\subsection{How much time I spent}
Searching the right papers takes me about 30\% of time overall my work. Read over the abstract and conclution helps me to undrstand the topic for each paper. As I mentioned, read through the paper takes me most of time, because I couldn't really easily to identify the fault model for each problems. Also, I spend some time for each paper's background study.

\subsection{The most diffcult issue I met}
The background knowledge may be the most difficult issue for me in this research. The fault-tolerance system applies to many area of studies. While reading the papers, I couldn't get some basic ideas for each topic, e.g. multi-cloud. Each papers shows its own different studies realted to other papers. Sometimes it's really hard to understand if I don't have enough background knowledge, so I need to search and read the definition for each topic. 

\subsection{Conclution}
 Fault-tolerance are applying to many different area. And during this research work, I could realize that the survivability for a system becoming more important than 10 years ago. Same as the way to guard our system, malicious acts are evloving as time goes by. Since we can not always prevent the fault occur, survivability and fault-tolerance become more important to think about what should we do after fault occur rather than prevent it happen.
